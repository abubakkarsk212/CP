You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5,
the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3, and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. You need to find and return
that duplicate number present in the array.

int findDuplicate(int *arr, int n)
{
  //   int *arr1 = new int[n-1];
  //   //Write your code here
  //   for(int i = 0 ;i <n; i++){
  //       arr1[arr[i]]+=1;
  //       if(arr1[arr[i]] >1){
  //           return arr[i];
  //       }
  //   }
  // delete arr1;
    int sumOfNminus = ((n-2) *(n-1))/2 ;
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
        sum+=arr[i];
    }
    return sum - sumOfNminus;
}
